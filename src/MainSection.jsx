            <h1>Changing the way we create art: The impact of artificial intelligence on creativity</h1>
            <span>Artificial intelligence is changing the way we think about creativity and art. With advances in machine learning, it's now possible for AI to create art automatically, generating images, music, and texts that have never existed before. Techniques like generative adversarial networks and style transfer are making this possible, and AI is even being used to compose music for movies and video games. As this technology continues to evolve, the possibilities for AI-generated art are endless.</span>
